# Goal:

Our aim here is to come up with a framework to test REST API with different HTTP Methods. This test will be driven through a spreadsheet and the spreadsheet will contain all the input parameters, API URL, HTTP Method, request JSON, text response should be used for assertion etc.

By using one single HTTP Sampler, we would like to send different types of request GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE. Even the HTTP Request body data will be added dynamically at run time.


This test was created using [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

json-server --watch db.json

My db.json looks like this.
{
   "books":[
 
   ],
   "comments":[
 
   ],
   "profile":{
      "name":"typicode"
   }
}
